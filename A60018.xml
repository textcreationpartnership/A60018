            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>More fierce than thoſe in Bellowing <hi>Aetna</hi> ſeen;</l>
                  <l>E'er you look down, and bid me live in peace;</l>
                  <l>E'er with one ſmile my labouring Soul you eaſe.</l>
                  <l>Ah! be more kind, or elſe appear leſs fair,</l>
                  <l>Yet bright as you deſtroying Angels are.</l>
                  <l>Forgive me, Heav'n! ſuch Parallels to make;</l>
                  <l>And you, dear Saint, forgive me what I ſpeak;</l>
                  <l>Forget what from a Mind in pain dares break.</l>
                  <l>O! ſhine my Sun, let kindly beams be hurl'd,</l>
                  <l>From your bright Eyes, into my little World;</l>
                  <l>O'er-caſt with Clouds of Diſcontent and Fear,</l>

                  <l>None are impatient, like to thoſe in Love.</l>
                  <l>Remember where Deſpair has fail'd to kill,</l>
                  <l>Where Grief, where Scorn could not the task fulfill.</l>

                  <l>The Sword, the gentler Cordial, has been us'd,</l>
                  <l>And thought more noble than to live refus'd:</l>

                  <p>I anſwer'd him with Tears, and more and more grew ſullen when he wooed; proteſted againſt his Love, and vow'd to ſacrifice my life rather than be his Bride: My Father chid me for my obſtinacy, and laid approaching Greatneſs in my view; urged and conjured me by the power of his Paternal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over me, to yield my ſelf obedient to his will. I anſwer'd him, My life was in his hand, and that he might command it when he pleas'd: But for my Love, it ſoared a nobler hight, and could not be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as being free by a Charter ancient as the World: He ſtormed at this, and ſaid, I Trifle with him, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36155:8"/>ſhould dearly ſuffer for my obſtinacy: I thereupon fell at his feet, o'er-whelmed with tears and ſighs, that wou'd have moved a Rock of Adamant, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged I might be free to make my choice: or if he would not grant it, as he had given me life, next to the workings of nature, and the inviſible power that infuſed that breath of life, which ought to act in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he wou'd ſtrike me dead, and kindly put an end to woes that might enſue: At this his Eyes ſhot fire, his Frowns me-thought looked like a Winter-cloud, frought with a thouſand ſtorms, at which I trembled, and look pale: But he, remorſleſs, told me. That in ſpite of all my denial and reſiſtance I muſt prepare the next day to be a Bride; at which my ſpirits failed, and I ſunk down into a deadly ſwoun, and in that plight he left me: For when I awoke as from the dead, and faintly reared my head, I found me in my Nurſes Arms; who pittying my diſtreſs, and moved by my tears and intreaties, my vows and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſacrificing my Life to my Father's anger, but not my Love, ſhe helped me to cordage, whereby I made my eſcape through the Window, though at the hazard of my life, by reaſon of it's hight; and have ſince obſcured my ſelf to give you notice by Letter to meet me in this place —</p>

               <p>MEN and Women were made for the Society of each other: and this Society becomes the more delectable when Beauty aſſiſts our Deſire. For as it is natural for Men and Women to deſire, ſo is it as natural for them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire what is moſt pleaſing, which is Beauty.</p>
               <p>Beauty then conſiſts in the Lineaments and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body, and the actions and demeanour of that beautifull Body. For there are ſome who have Beauty, but no beautifull deportment. Others who have ſomething, I cannot tell what that pleaſes, who cannot for all that be call'd beautifull.

                  </gap>taining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; her Arms thick and plump; her Skin neither too white nor too brown, but of a mixture between both. As to her Conditions, let her be decently and faſhionably habited, modeſt and gay in her actions, not over-talkative, yet witty in her diſcourſe. When ſhe appears naked, let her have a full, round Belly, little Feet, and turning outward, a Leg ſomewhat plum in the middle, Knees ſhort and ſmall, a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rais'd Thigh, well furniſhed with hard and round But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, a ſmall Waft.</p>
               <p>As for the Beauty of a Man, it conſiſts chiefly in his ſhape and proportion, and in the ſtrength of his body; however, let him be faſhionable, as well in his habit as behaviour; let him be rather lean than fat, his Hair long and curling upon his ſhoulders, his Neck ſhort and free, with a Breaſt velveted with ſhort hair; his Shoulders, Reinsand Buttocks large and brawnie.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the exactneſſes of Perfection required in both Sexes, but becauſe all perſons are not both to be accompliſhed, therefore as well Men as Women muſt be content with their fortune: However, when a Man firſt goes about to court a Miſtriſs, let her be ſuch a one, as to his fancy may ſeem to excell all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Women.

If her Fan or her Glove fall by accident, let him be in an inſtant ready to take them up. Slight ſervices many times create a deep affection.

               <p>Dear Lady, why should not you affect that love which you your ſelf have created? would you cauſe it to be born, and dye at the ſame inſtant? That would be the action of an inconſtant ſoul.</p>
               <p>Sir, it is you that run the hazard of being call'd inconſtant: For if Love proceed from Merit, you will ſoon find ſome one more worthy of your affection than my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Madam, I shall never ſeek the means to find any more ſignal worth then what you your ſelf poſſeſs. It is permitted to thoſe who are leſs worthy to have ſuch jealouſies; but not to you whoſe beauty has ſuch a ſuper-eminence above all other in the World. No, Madam, take counſel of your own worth, and it will shew the fair Election I have made; how impoſſible it is to be chang'd; the deſign coming from the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul, which being divine, cannot err.

Therefore ſince you have this Glory entire to your ſelf, to have vanquish'd all the World, there remains nothing more but that you should vanquish your ſelf.</p>
